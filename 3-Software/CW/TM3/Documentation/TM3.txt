Module "EI2C1"     (component SW_I2C)
   - EI2C1_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as the SLAVE, 
                this method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgement 
                at the end of transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads one character (byte) from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads one character (byte) from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes the block of characters to the bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or 
                initialization), the block is moved to the output buffer if the <Output buffer size> property is different from 
                zero. The content of the output buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the end when the 
                component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is 
                cleared. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization 
                section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to 
                the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master but the 
                master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block 
                byte transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads the block of characters from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the 
                "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a 
                SLAVE, this method reads the block of characters from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SelectSlave -When working as a MASTER, this method selects a new slave for communication by its slave address value. 
                Any send or receive method are directed to or from the selected device, until a new slave device is selected by 
                this method. If the selected slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, as the parameter 7 bits must be passed, which 
                involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of slave address (XX). The second byte of the 10-bit 
                slave address must be sent to the slave as a general character of send methods. This method is available only 
                if the component is in MASTER mode.
   - EI2C1_GetSelected -When working as a MASTER, this method returns the identification address value of the slave, which is 
                currently selected for communication with the master. If the current slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, the 
                method returns the first 7 bits only, which involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of the 
                slave address (XX). This method is not able to return the rest value of 10-bit slave address. This method is 
                available only if the component is in MASTER mode.

                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as the SLAVE, 
                this method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgement 
                at the end of transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.

Module "Vtim0ch2"  (component InterruptVector)

Module "TEST_IN_4" (component BitIO)
   - TEST_IN_4_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for

                value of the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe 
                mode> property for limitations).
   - TEST_IN_0_3_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] 
                then it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last

                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - RST_SHT_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S12ZVLS32_32)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.   For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU. 
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.   For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
