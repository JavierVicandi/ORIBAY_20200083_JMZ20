**     Abstract    :
**         This component "InterruptVector" gives an access to interrupt vector.
**         The purpose of this component is to allocate the interrupt vector
**         in the vector table. Additionally it can provide settings of
**         the interrupt priority register.
**         The interrupt handling routines must be implemented by the user.
**     Settings    :
**         Interrupt vector            : Vsci0
**         Handle name                 : SCI0_INT
**         Interrupt request reg.      : SCI0SR1   [0x0704]
**         Interrupt enable reg.       : SCI0CR2   [0x0703]
